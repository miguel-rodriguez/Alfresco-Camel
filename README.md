#Alfresco-Apache Camel


What is it?
-----------

This project shows how to use Apache Camel for Alfresco integration projects. Apache Camel (http://camel.apache.org/) is an integration framework whose main goal is to make integration easier. It implements many of the EIP patterns and allows you to focus on solving business problems, freeing you from the burden of plumbing.

Whith Apache Camel you can set up routes to upload/download content and metadata from Alfresco or integrate Alfresco with external systems i.e. Box

Please refer to document ```Alfresco integrations with Apache Camel.docx``` for further information.
